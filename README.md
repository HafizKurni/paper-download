# üîó Scribd Download Link Generator (Streamlit App)

This is a simple Streamlit web application that replicates the PDF download logic from the "Scribd Content Viewer/Downloader" JavaScript userscript.

It provides a simple UI to paste any Scribd document URL. The app then parses this URL to extract the document's ID and title, and uses them to construct a download URL that points to a third-party downloader service.

This app **does not** scrape or download any content itself; it only generates a link based on the logic found in the original userscript.

## üöÄ How to Run the App

You can run this application locally on your machine.

**Requirements:**

  * Python 3.7+

1.  **Install the required library:**
    Open your terminal and install Streamlit using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```

2.  **Save the Code:**
    Save the application code as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).

3.  **Run the App:**
    In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run:
